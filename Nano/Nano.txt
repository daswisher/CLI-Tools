Nano is another text editor similar to vim. It is very simple and all of 
the commands are displayed on a bar at the bottom. In order to install 
Nano on windows, visit www.nano-editor.org. There will be a file 
download that includes the dll files as well as the nano exectuable 
file. Extract the dll and exe to the windows directory (C:/Windows). As 
soon as that's done, nano can be called within cmd or powershell by 
typing "nano."
