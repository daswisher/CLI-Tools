There are a number of different commands used in powershell that are similar to bash.
The first set are get commands:
get-service <<This returns all services active and inactive
get-process <<This returns only running process along with process info

	Ex: get-process waterfox <<Returns info like pid, usage, etc
stop-process <<Used to kill process, but you have to use pid instead of process name
start-process <<Starts a process, but you use process name instead of pid



Navigation commands are a hybrid of bash and cmd:
ls <<list directory contents
dir <<is the same thing as ls
cd << change directory
	cd .. << goes back one level
	cd / <<goes to root directory
<tab key> << auto complete


There are also a series of commands that are similar to bash commands for creation and deletion:
mkdir <<makes a directory
rmdir <<deletes a directory
echo $null > <file name> <<same as the touch command to make empty files
<<<<<rm on a directory that has children will prompt for recursive delete>>>>>
